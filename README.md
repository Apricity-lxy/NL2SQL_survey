 <h1 align="center">NL2SQL Handbook</h1>
 
From this repository, you can view the latest advancements in NL2SQL. This handbook corresponds to our survey **"A Survey of NL2SQL with Large Language Models: Where are we, and where are we going?"** which you can access via [this link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05109). If you are a novice, don't worry‚Äîwe have prepared a practical guide for you, covering a wide range of foundational materials [here](#-practical-guide-for-novice).

## üß≠ NL2SQL Introduction 
Translating users' natural language queries (NL) into SQL queries can significantly reduce barriers to accessing relational databases and support various commercial applications. The performance of NL2SQL has been greatly improved with the emergence of language models (LMs). In this context, it is crucial to assess our current position, determine the NL2SQL solutions that should be adopted for specific scenarios by practitioners, and identify the research topics that researchers should explore next.

## üìà NL2SQL Lifecycle

</p>

+ Model: NL2SQL translation techniques that tackle not only NL ambiguity and under-specification, but also properly map NL with database schema and instances;

+ Data: From the collection of training data, data synthesis due to training data scarcity, to NL2SQL benchmarks;

+ Evaluation: Evaluating NL2SQL methods from multiple angles using different metrics and granularities;

+ Error Analysis: analyzing NL2SQL errors to find the root cause and guiding NL2SQL models to evolve.

## ü§î Where Are We?
We categorize the challenges of NL2SQL into five levels and define each level's specific challenges. The first three levels focus on challenges that have been addressed or are still being tackled, affirming the progressive development of NL2SQL. The fourth level symbolizes the challenges we aim to resolve in the stage of LLMs. Finally, the fifth level represents our aspirations for the ultimate NL2SQL system. 

We describe the evolution of NL2SQL solutions from the perspective of language models, categorizing it into four stages.
For each stage of NL2SQL, we analyze the changes in target users and the extent to which challenges are addressed.

## üß© Module-based NL2SQL Methods
We summarize the key modules of NL2SQL solutions
utilizing the language model. 
+ **Pre-processing** serves as an enhancement to the model‚Äôs inputs in the NL2SQL parsing process. You can get more details from this chapter: [Pre-Processing](chapter/Pre_Processing.md)
+ **NL2SQL translation methods** constitute the core of the NL2SQL solution, responsible for converting input natural language queries into SQL queries. You can get more details from this chapter: [NL2SQL Translation Methods](chapter/Translation_method.md)
+ **Post-processing** is a crucial step to refine the generated SQL queries, ensuring they meet user expectations more accurately. You can get more details from this chapter: [Post-Processing](chapter/Post_Processing.md)
