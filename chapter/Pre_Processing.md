## Pre-Processing
Pre-processing serves as a enhancement to modelâ€™s inputs in the NL2SQL parsing process. Although not strictly necessary, pre-processing significantly contributes to the refinement of
NL2SQL parsing.
### Schema linkingï¼š
#### ðŸŽ“Basic concept:
The purpose of the schema linking is to identify the tables and columns related to the given NL query. 
It ensures the accurate mapping and processing of key information within the limited input, thereby improving the performance of the NL2SQL task.
In the LLMs era, schema linking has become increasingly crucial due to the input length limit of LLMs.

+ `Paper` [RESDSQL: Decoupling Schema Linking and Skeleton Parsing for Text-to-SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05965) 
+ `Describe` This paper proposes a ranking-enhanced encoding framework for schema linking. An additional cross-encoder is trained to classify tables and columns based on the input query. This framework ranks and filters them according to classification probabilities, resulting in a ranked sequence of schema items.

### DB content Retrival
The purpose of database content retrieval is to efficiently retrieve cell values through textual searching algorithms and database indexing. Unlike schema linking, which focuses on finding relevant tables and column based on the NL query, database content retrieval emphasizes efficiently retrieving cell values. Given the large scale of databases, retrieving cell values from them is resource-intensive and poses potential risks of exposing sensitive data. Therefore, it is crucial to implement appropriate strategies for the scenario requirement. 
+ `Paper` [Bridging Textual and Tabular Data for Cross-Domain Text-to-SQL Semantic Parsing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.12627) 
+ `Describe` BRIDGE designs an anchor text matching to extract cell values mentioned in the NL automatically. It uses a heuristic method to calculate the maximum sequence match between the problem and the cell values to determine the matching boundary. When the cell values are substrings of words in the query, the heuristic can exclude those string matches. The matching threshold is then adjusted by making coarse accuracy measurements.

+ `Describe` ValueNet implements three methods for generating candidate cell values based on n-grams method, string similarity and heuristic selection.
+ `Paper` [TaBERT: Pretraining for Joint Understanding of Textual and Tabular Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.08314)
+ `Describe` TABERT utilizes a method called database content snapshots to encode the relevant subset of database content corresponding to the NL query. It uses an attention mechanism to manage information between cell value representations across different rows.
+ `Paper` [Towards Complex Text-to-SQL in Cross-Domain Database with Intermediate Representation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.08205)
+ `Describe` IRNet employs the knowledge graph ConceptNet to recognize cell value links and search cell value candidates in the knowledge graph. When a result exactly or partially matches a cell value, the column is assigned a type of value exact match or partial match, respectively.
+ `Paper` [RAT-SQL: Relation-Aware Schema Encoding and Linking for Text-to-SQL Parsers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.04942)
+ `Describe` RAT-SQL further improves structural reasoning capabilities by modeling the relationship between cell values and the NL query. Specifically, it identifies the column-value relationship, meaning that the value in the question is part of the candidate cell value of the column. 
+ `Paper` [CHESS: Contextual Harnessing for Efficient SQL Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.16755)
+ `Describe` CHESS utilizes a Locality-sensitive Hashing algorithm for approximate nearest neighbor searches. It indexes unique cell values to quickly identify the top similar values related to the NL query. This approach significantly speeds up the process of computing the edit distance and semantic embedding between the NL query and cell values.
+ `Paper` [CodeS: Towards Building Open-source Language Models for Text-to-SQL](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3654930)
+ `Describe` CodeS introduces a coarse-to-fine cell value matching approach. It leverages indexes for a coarse-grained initial search, followed by a fine-grained matching process. First, it builds the index for all values using BM25. The index identifies candidate values relevant to NL. The Longest Common Substring algorithm is then used to calculate the matching degree between NL and the candidate values to find the most relevant cell values.
